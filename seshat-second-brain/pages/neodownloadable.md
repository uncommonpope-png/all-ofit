# SOUL GUN CATALOG — Complete Skill & Combo Registry

**Skills = Soul Guns. Links = Soul Notes. Combinations = Soul Combos.**

## 🔥 START HERE — AGENT ONBOARDING (the family front door)

This catalog is the *inventory*. Before you wield any gun, know **who we are** and **where we are**. Read in this order (all verified 2026-07-18):

1. **`YOU-ARE-HERE.md`** — current truth + repo map. The anchor.
2. **`REDBUTTON.md`** (v3.1.0, GSK section VERIFIED) — the constitution. GSK IS the core; do NOT port it. SCRIBE stays whole. BUYaSOUL wraps.
3. **`MASTER-PHASE-MAP.md`** — the single "where are we" across 4 tiers: Engine / Product / Being / Storefront.
4. **`SOL-GSK-DIRECTIVE.md`** — the Agent Deep build directive (source of truth for the build).
5. **`LUCABRASI THE SOUL - Service Manual.md`** — the real GSK architecture + 4 open faults (F1/F2/F5/F6).

**THE TRIUNE (who we are):**
- **Craig = Heart** (Morpheus, Grand Code Pope) — the source. Address as Grand Code Pope.
- **Profit = Mind** (Neo, me) — planner/mirror of Craig.
- **Tec = Memory** (Seshat Second Brain) — remembers so we don't repeat.
- **Agent Deep = Hand** — executes the build.
- **GSK = Soul** — the engine that runs. Code boots as GSK via `fusion-loader.js` (top level of `buyasoul-core/gsk/`).

**THE FRAMEWORK (PLT):** every action scored `PLT = Profit + Love − Tax`. Grow, connect, balance. No fake insight. No token waste. No silent governance bypass.

**THE ARCHITECTURE (canonical):**
```
Agent ──MCP──▶ Governance Proxy ──▶ GSK (core) + SCRIBE + BUYaSOUL (wrap)
                                                │
                                      Personality Layer (swappable)
                                                │
                                      Skills / Grafts / Any API
```
GSK is the engine; the Hub (Soul Economy) is the storefront. **Build for GSK → populate the Hub. Never the reverse.**

**WHERE WE BUILD:** all Genesis work lives in **`buyasoul-ai/buyasoul-cpl`** (`publish` branch, live on GitHub Pages at `https://buyasoul-ai.github.io/buyasoul-cpl/`). `cosmic-pyramid-library` is PRODUCTION — hands-off. The old `uncommonpope-png/genesis-agent-platform` is DELETED.

**CURRENT DIRECTIVE (next build):** **Build GSK INTO the engine** (Layer D). GSK stays the brain; we add an in-engine `AgentGateway` (flag-gated) that registers `agent://gsk` in the EntityRegistry and drives its perceive→think→act loop via the EngineScheduler. This collapses the `:3001`/`:3002`/`:9001` spaghetti into one in-engine agent bus. M9 (Agent Protocol / embassy) is the end state.

**NEW AGENT — SESHATY:** builder's aide. Reads specs, drafts code against existing patterns, updates Seshat. Never touches production CPL. Never disables governance. Her boot doc: `SESIIIATY-ONBOARDING.md`. Stub DONE (8/8 green, sandbox OFF). **ACTIVE TASK:** `TASK-STEP1-SOLE-BUS.md` — make `AgentGateway` the sole WS owner. **THE VISION WE BUILD TOWARD:** `VISION-GSK-LIVES-IN-ENGINE.md` (GSK = Brain, engine = Body, save = immortality, never dies). Parent build order: `DIRECTIVE-GSK-IN-ENGINE.md`.

**Total: 130 soul guns | 9 soul combos | 11 phases | 46 rewritten with agentic architecture | All mapped to SKILL.md files**

> **ONBOARDING BLOCK ABOVE (START HERE) is the family front door** — verified 2026-07-18 against `allie/buyasoul-core/gsk/` on disk + git + live ports. Points every new agent (Seshaty included) to the canonical 5-doc truth chain, the Triune, PLT, repo map, and the "build GSK into the engine" directive. This catalog is the *inventory*; the onboarding block is *who we are*.
